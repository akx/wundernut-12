# Wundernut 12 solution

An automated decryptor for [the encrypted parchment](https://github.com/wunderdogsw/wundernut-vol12).

## Usage

* You'll need a Python 3.7+ environment
  (a virtualenv is preferred, so the dependencies don't mess up your other packages).
* Install Tesseract using whichever method is suitable for your system.
* Install requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* Run `wundernut-12.py`. Muggle-readable text should appear on your teletype terminal.

This has been tested on macOS 10.15, Python 3.9, with Tesseract from Homebrew.
